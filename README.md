![Community A-4E-C for DCS World](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46121009/57830942-41b3da00-77e6-11e9-8e8c-1b7274927bb0.jpg)

The A-4 was a cold war workhorse which proved to be a capable, reliable light attack aircraft to dozens of nations around the world. From the jungles of southeast Asia, to the desert of Sinai, to the coasts of South America, the scooter was a common sight above battlefields around the world for decades.

The Community A-4E-C represents more than three years of work on behalf of the development team. We're proud to present our most comprehensive DCS World module to date, featuring a realistic flight model, improved systems, increased functionality across all DCS World's available maps, including full carrier compatibility and air-to-air refueling, unique sounds, keybinds and features to increase ease of use and immersion when flying this now-venerable module.

We thank the DCS World community for their support and contributions over the years, and dedicate the module to our friend, mentor and lead coder, Eric "Gospadin" Mudama. His passion and brilliance left a mark on us all. This labor of love which would not have been possible without him.

## Installation

Failure to perform these steps will result in DCS World not recognizing the module, inability to use the module, input errors when using the module, or client integrity check failures on multiplayer servers that require them. Never install the A-4E-C files directly into your DCS World installation files!

### STEP 1: Upgrading from an older release

If you are upgrading from an older version of the A-4E-C, perform these following actions. 

First, completely delete the currently installed A-4E-C files before installing the new version.

- Delete the contents of `C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS\Mods\aircraft\A-4E-C`

Next, your A-4E-C input bindings must be reset and rebound. If this is a new installation, you can skip this step and move on to Step 2.

- Delete the contents of `C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS\Config\Input\A-4E-C`

### STEP 2: Installing the module files.

- Download the latest official A-4E-C release package. Do not download directly from the Github repository.
- Place the included `Mods\aircraft\A-4E-C` folder in into your `C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS` folder.
- If you have installed other DCS World mods, you might already have the `Mods` and `aircraft` folders indicated in the file path. If this is the case, merge the new A-4E-C folder into the existing folders.

Your correctly installed files should look something like the following image, substituting your Windows account name where the image displays Partario. If you're using the release branch of DCS World, the folder is `DCS` instead of `DCS.openbeta`.

### STEP 3: Launch DCS World and verify installation

When you are confident your files are correctly installed, launch DCS World. If your installation was successful, the A-4E-C theme icon appears as a option in the main menu:

![Image of DCS World Menu with A-4E-C installed](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518815335013679104/884483447169617920/unknown.png)

## Installation Troubleshooting

- Never, ever install the A-4E-C files directly into your DCS World installation files! This will cause your DCS World to not locate the module, create conflicts with other modules, and other problems.

- If you have multiple DCS-related folders in your `C:\Users\username\Saved Games`, for example, `DCS`, or `DCS.openbeta`. If you are unsure which folder your DCS World installation is using, locate the `dcs_variant.txt` file in the game files. If this file is present, its contents determines the folder structure your DCS World installation is using.

- If you are recieving an authorization error, you have installed the module incorrectly. Double check the installation instructions above, ensure you have have installed the module to the correct folder, and do not have any improperly installed files remaining in your DCS world game files. Any conflicts will result in the persistence of this this error.

- If you find you can't take control of the aircraft, ensure you have installed Microsoft's Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 Redistributable libraries. Windows users running DCS world are typically running x64, so you will want to download and install vc_redist.x64.exe (~15 MB) from the following page, install the library, and then restart your computer: (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0)

- If you cannot find the A-4E-C as a unit option in the Mission Editor, Ensure the historical mode filter is disabled in the mission editor by toggling the clock icon at the bottom of the screen, as shown in the following screenshot:

![Image of the Mission Editor pointing out the location of the Historical Filter](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518814186739073024/759230033960763422/unknown.png)

## Frequently Asked Questions and Troubleshooting

**Q: Is it really free?**

- Yes, it's really free!

**Q: How large is the module?**

- Installation size is around 1 GB.

**Q: Can I donate to the A-4E-C project?**

- We cannot accept donations, but we appreciate your words of support! There are so many good causes out there. Consider donating to one of those instead!

**Q: Can I get involved with the A-4E-C project?**

- Yes! [Join the Community A-4E-C Discord server](https://discord.gg/tQZbkTQ) and introduce yourself! We can always use a hand from game artists, programmers or reliable testers as we continue to move the project forward. If you think you have something to contribute, don't hesitate!

**Q: Is there a user manual or tutorials available?**

- There is helpful pilot guidance included in the kneeboard. The NATOPS manual for an A-4E/F is the gold standard.
- [Sidekick65's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4kJt_8Jw9ByL10ar6b8rQg) features high-quality tutorials on weapon systems.

**Q: Is there a paint kit I can use to create my own A-4E-C liveries?**

- Yes! This [A-4E-C Paintkit](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19w_bD8xHJiZpAi1JbA2xyPDJpl9dje-4) includes the aircraft's top, bottom and fuel tanks. See the included liveries for helpful examples when setting up you *description.lua* files. 
- If you created liveries for older versions of the A-4E-C, you might need to update them to accommodate new changes in the external model's material names.

**Q: Can I fly the A-4E-C as a tanker?**

- Not at this time.

**Q: What about the AGM-12 Bullpup or AGM-62 Walleye?**

- No, implementing additional guided weapons would require access to the SDK. Additionally, the specific airframe/cockpit that we have modelled is not equipped to accommodate the AGM-62 Walleye. A-4Es that were able to carry the AGM-62 Walleye had the ground radar display replaced with a TV monitor for use with the AGM-62 Walleye.

**Q: Why is my standalone server rejecting missions with the A-4E-C?**

- A standalone server requires an installation of the A-4E-C module in order to host any missions that feature it.

**Q: Is there a way I can host missions with the A-4E-C on my multiplayer server that won't lock out players who do not have the module installed?**

- Yes, but it's a little involved. It's not DCS that is locking players out, but the Mission Editor deciding that any mission with an A4-E-C placed down is going to require the module. As there's no in-engine way of de-flagging this, you'll need to get hands-on with your mission files.
- You may or may not already know that the *.miz* mission files are, in fact, *.zip* files. So, take the mission file you desire to edit, and make a copy with a *.zip* extension. Find somewhere handy to unzip it.
- Inside, you will find a *mission* file (no extension). Open this file in your text-editor of choice, and search required to find the mission's list of required modules under the **["requiredModules"]**  listings, and then remove the A-4E-C entry from the list, as shown in Line 32 in this screenshot:

![Image of a mission file with the A4-E-C required module on Line 32](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518815335013679104/851940052627095633/unknown.png)

- Save the mission file, and re-create a new *.zip* (carefully maintaining proper folder structure, *of course*) and rename the *.zip* file with a *.miz* file extension instead.
- Test your altered mission by yourself or with a friend to ensure it loads properly, and that clients are able to load into the mission or server without the A4-E-C installed. In this instance, DCS will display any A4-E-C units as default-livery Su-27s, and players without the module will  not be able to take control of the module, as if they did not own an official aircraft.

**Q: Are there any plans to do other variants or later models of the A-4?**

- There are no plans nor keen interest to pursue this. There is a lot left to add for our beloved A-4E-C, and the advanced avionics in later models would not be able to be completed in a satisfying manner.

**Q: Are there any plans to make the module official, obtain the Eagle Dynamics SDK, or make the module a part of the default DCS install package?**

- No, the A-4E-C will continue on as a free and open-source resource you can download and install to enjoy.

**Q: Why doesn't the A-4E-C work with my favorite mission or multiplayer scripting system?**

- Some scripts or other utilities need to be informed of the A-4E-C's existence in order to accommodate it. If you have a favorite popular mod, script that should accommodate it, be sure to let the author know!

**Q: What's the song in the menu?**
- Crow, by [Eric Haugen](https://erichaugen.bandcamp.com/releases)
